# TicTacToe80s

A tic-tac-toe game with an 80s arcade aesthetic. Built with Expo + React Native + TypeScript.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) installed on your phone, or an iOS/Android simulator

## Installation

```bash
npm install --cache /tmp/npm-cache-ttt
```

> If you run into npm cache permission errors, fix them first with:
> ```bash
> sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm
> ```
> Then run `npm install` normally.

## Running

```bash
npx expo start
```

- Scan the QR code with **Expo Go** (iOS or Android)
- Press `i` to open in the iOS simulator
- Press `a` to open in the Android emulator
- Press `w` to open in the browser (web mode)

## Project structure

```
TicTacToe80s/
├── App.tsx        # Full game: logic + UI + styles
├── index.ts       # Entry point (registerRootComponent)
├── app.json       # Expo configuration
├── tsconfig.json  # TypeScript in strict mode
└── assets/        # Icons generated by Expo
```

## How to play

1. Two players take turns on the same device
2. **X** goes first (magenta)
3. **O** goes second (cyan)
4. First to align 3 in a row, column or diagonal wins
5. If all 9 cells are filled with no winner: draw
6. Tap **[ NEW GAME ]** to restart

## Style

| Element | Color |
|---|---|
| Background | Black `#000000` |
| Title | Blinking yellow `#FFE600` |
| X | Magenta `#FF00FF` |
| O | Cyan `#00FFFF` |
| Cells / borders | Neon green `#00FF41` |
| Winning cells | Golden border |

## Technical decisions

- **Single file** (`App.tsx`) to keep things as simple as possible
- **No external libraries** — only React Native and Expo built-in APIs
- **TypeScript strict mode** — `Player`, `Cell`, `Board` types defined explicitly
- **Animated API** for the title blink loop and status slide-in animation
- Monospace font is selected automatically per platform (`Courier New` on iOS, `monospace` on Android)
